## Hello everyone ðŸ‘¾ , My name is Philipp

I am a web developer and UX designer based in the beautiful
Yekaterinburg. I really enjoy solving problems as well as making
things pretty and easy to use. I can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. I also love photography, a hobby I'm taking along since the good old film cameras. Oh, and cycling; I have a passion for cycling! For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including popular frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS. I also make the web pretty by using Sass, CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc. I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry standards and I love working with them. I'm not limited to them, though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications that I've been working with. User interfaces, brochures, books, branding. You name it! As I mentioned, creating pretty things is particularly important for me.
